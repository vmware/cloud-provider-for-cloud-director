This extension is intended to be installed into a Kubernetes cluster installed with [VMware Cloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-director.html) as a Cloud Provider, by a user that has the rights as described in the sections below.

**cloud-provider-for-cloud-director** is distributed as a container image hosted at [Distribution Harbor](https://projects.registry.vmware.com) as `projects.registry.vmware.com/vmware-cloud-director/cloud-provider-for-cloud-director:<CPI Version>`

This cloud-provider is in a `GA` state and will be supported in production.

Note: The cloud-provider is not impacted by the Apache Log4j open source component vulnerability.

## Terminology
1. VCD: VMware Cloud Director
2. ClusterAdminRole: This is the role that has enough rights to create and administer a Kubernetes Cluster in VCD. This role can be created by cloning the [vApp Author Role](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html) and then adding the following rights (details on adding the rights below can be found in the [CSE docs](https://vmware.github.io/container-service-extension/cse3_1/RBAC.html#additional-required-rights)):
   1. Full Control: VMWARE:CAPVCDCLUSTER
   2. Edit: VMWARE:CAPVCDCLUSTER
   3. View: VMWARE:CAPVCDCLUSTER
3. ClusterAdminUser: For CPI functionality, there needs to be a set of additional rights added to the `ClusterAdminRole` as described in the "Additional Rights for CPI" section below. The Kubernetes Cluster needs to be **created** by a user belonging to this **enhanced** `ClusterAdminRole`. For convenience, let us term this user as the `ClusterAdminUser`.

## VMware Cloud Director Configuration
In this section, we assume that the Kubernetes cluster is created using the Container Service Extension 4.0. However, that is not a mandatory requirement.

**Note:** NSX-T with NSX Advanced Load Balancer is a prerequisite to use LoadBalancers with CPI of VCD.

### Additional Rights for CPI
The `ClusterAdminUser` should have view access to the vApp containing the Kubernetes cluster. Since the `ClusterAdminUser` itself creates the cluster, it will have this access by default.
This `ClusterAdminUser` needs to be created from a `ClusterAdminRole` with the following additional rights:

1. Gateway =>
   1. View Gateway
2. Gateway Services =>
   1. NAT Configure (adds NAT View)
   2. LoadBalancer Configure (adds LoadBalancer View)
3. Access Control =>
   1. User => Manage user's own API TOKEN

The `Access Control` right is needed in order to generate refresh tokens for the `ClusterAdminUser`.

### Instances Interface: Node Lifecycle Management (LCM)
There is no particular configuration needed in order to use the Node LCM.

### Services Interface: LoadBalancer Configuration

#### Provider Setup
The LoadBalancers using the CPI of VCD need a preconfigured Avi Controller, NSX-T Cloud and Avi Service Engine Group. This is a provider operation.

Please follow best practices of configuring NSX ALB with VCD for multi-tenant environment.

The LoadBalancer section of the Edge Gateway for a Tenant should be enabled, and the appropriate Service Engine Group(s) should be configured into the Edge Gateway. This will be used to create Virtual Services when a LoadBalancer request is made from Kubernetes.

#### Tenant Setup
A ServiceEngineGroup needs to be added to the gateway of the OVDC within which the Kubernetes cluster is to be created. The overall steps to achieve that are documented at [Enable Load Balancer on an NSX-T Data Center Edge Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-1784B96B-20F8-4E4D-BF33-86D2264EDBCF.html)

#### Creation of a LoadBalancer using a third-party ingress
Any third party ingress such as Contour could be used with the CPI in order to create an L7 ingress and NSX Advanced Load Balancer with Avi will act as the L4 LoadBalancer.

**Note**: In order to create a HTTPS Ingress using the Avi LoadBalancer, a certificate needs to be used. The following steps present an overview **from CPI 1.1.0 onwards**:
1. As a user with OrgAdmin role, upload a certificate in Certificates Library of the Organization using the VCD UI. Let this certificate be called `my-service-cert`.

2. Add the following annotations to the ingress loadbalancer service. Depending on the installation method used (helm etc), the location of addition of these annotations may be different. The annotation mentions the _comma-separated list of ports_ that need SSL and the (single) certificate to be used for it.
```
annotations:
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/vcloud-avi-ssl-ports: "443"
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/vcloud-avi-ssl-cert-alias: "my-service-cert"
```

3. Install the service

This will enable the HTTPS ingresses of the Kubernetes cluster to use the fore-mentioned certificate that has been uploaded here.

**Note:**
1. From v1.1.0 onwards, certificates can have user-defined names. Each service could use its own certificate and there does not need to be one common certificate used across services.
2. The `appProtocol` field is used to determine if a service is a HTTP/HTTPS/TCP service and a cert is expected for an HTTPS service. If this behavior is not needed, overrides are to be specified as required by the service installation method.

### Virtual Service Shared IP (VCD >= 10.4.0)
As of CPI 1.2.0, the `enableVirtualServiceSharedIP` feature allows utilizing a feature in VCD >= 10.4.0 in which multiple virtual services can be created with the same external ip and different ports. This removes the need to create a dnat rule.
`enableVirtualServiceSharedIP` must be set to `true` in the configmap to use this feature:

```
loadbalancer:
   enableVirtualServiceSharedIP: true
```

Note: if `enableVirtualServiceSharedIP`  is set to `true` and `oneArm` is not `nil`, this means that the virtual services will share an internal ip instead of an external ip. DNAT rules are used to map the shared internal ip to an external ip.

### Specify an IP for the application load balancer
When creating a load balancer type service in Kubernetes, explicitly specify a load balancer IP address by configuring the service as follows. Let us assume the application load balancer need to be created using the IP address `10.10.10.10`.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 10.10.10.10
```

An internal IP address, such as 192.168.x.x, can also be used for `loadBalancerIP`.

Note: Updating the user specified load balancer IP is not supported when CPI is configured with `enableVirtualServiceSharedIP: true` and `oneArm: nil`.

### Disable SSL termination at NSX-T Avi load balancer
To disable SSL termination at NSX-T Avi load balancer and have ingress control SSL termination, add the following annotation to the ingress load balancer service.

```
annotations:
  service.beta.kubernetes.io/vcloud-avi-ssl-no-termination: "true"
```


## Troubleshooting
### Log VCD requests and responses

Execute the following command to log HTTP requests to VCD and HTTP responses from VCD -
```shell
kubectl set env -n kube-system deployment/vmware-cloud-director-ccm GOVCD_LOG_ON_SCREEN=true -oyaml
```
Once the above command is executed, CPI will start logging the HTTP requests and HTTP responses made via go-vcloud-director SDK.
The container logs can be obtained using the command `kubectl logs -n kube-system <CPI Pod>`

To stop logging the HTTP requests and responses from VCD, the following command can be executed -
```shell
kubectl set env -n kube-system deployment/vmware-cloud-director-ccm GOVCD_LOG_ON_SCREEN-
```

**NOTE: Please make sure to collect the logs before and after enabling the wire log. The above commands update the CPI deployment, which creates a new CPI pod. The logs present in the old pod will be lost.**

## Upgrade CPI
To upgrade CPI from v1.2.0 and v1.3.0, please do the following. `kubectl patch` will not work to upgrade CPI.
1. Delete the Kubernetes External Cloud Provider deployment using `kubectl delete deployment`
2. Apply the manifest at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/cloud-provider-for-cloud-director/1.4.0/manifests/cloud-director-ccm.yaml using `kubectl apply`

## Known Issues
1. IP is not obtained for LoadBalancer Service if Edge Gateway has IP Spaces.
   * While IP spaces are not supported in CPI 1.4.0, this is an issue because having IP spaces doesn't allow CPI to get a free IP for a LoadBalancer Service.
   * Workaround: Users can specify an IP to be used in `spec.loadBalancerIP` for the LoadBalancer Service.
2. LoadBalancer Services with the same name in different namespaces can be bound to the same IP.
   * This issue is occurring LoadBalancer service names are not unique (e.g., by including the namespace in the name).
   * Workaround: Users should create a unique name or add the namespace to the LoadBalancer Service name.
3. Updating service from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP` does not clean up all LoadBalancer service CCM resources.
   * If a DNAT is used, this may get cleaned up, but the virtual service and pools may still remain.
   * Workaround: Delete the LoadBalancer service and recreate the service.
