# Kubernetes External Cloud Provider for VMware Cloud Director

**cloud-provider-for-cloud-director** contains the source code and build methods to implement and deploy a Kubernetes Cloud Provider with [VMware Cloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-director.html). This Cloud Provider implements the controllers for [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/#service-controller) and [Instances](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/#node-controller) which would enable users to deploy Ingresses and also manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes nodes, which are [VMware Cloud Director VMs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.0/com.vmware.vcloud.tenantportal.doc/GUID-8F806B38-2489-4D36-82FF-B23BAFC3B294.html) in this Cloud Provider.

The version of the VMware Cloud Director API and Installation that are compatible for a given cloud-provider container image are described in the following compatibility matrix:

| CPI Version | VMware Cloud Director API | VMware Cloud Director Installation | Notes |
| :---------: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------------------: | :---: |
| 0.1.0.latest | 36.0+ | 10.2+ | Needs NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi) version 20.1.1+ |

This extension is intended to be installed into a Kubernetes cluster installed with [VMware Cloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-director.html) as a Cloud Provider, by a user that has the same rights as a [vApp Author](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/9.7/com.vmware.vcloud.admin.doc/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html).

**cloud-provider-for-cloud-director** is distributed as a container image hosted at [Distribution Harbor](https://projects.registry.vmware.com) as `projects.registry.vmware.com/vmware-cloud-director/cloud-provider-for-cloud-director:<version>`.

This cloud-provider is in a preliminary `alpha` state and is not yet ready to be used in production.

## VMware Cloud Director Configuration

### Instances Interface: Node Lifecycle Management (LCM)
There is no particular configuration needed for a [vApp Author Role](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/9.7/com.vmware.vcloud.admin.doc/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html) in order to use the Node LCM.

### Services Interface: LoadBalancer Configuration

#### Rights needed by the user
The [vApp Author Role](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/9.7/com.vmware.vcloud.admin.doc/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html) must have the following additional rights in order to create an NSX-T Load Balancer:
1. Edge Gateway View
2. Nat Configure (which also enables Nat View)
3. LoadBalancer Configure (which also enables LoadBalancer View)

These rights should be assigned by a user with the [Organization Administrator](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/9.7/com.vmware.vcloud.admin.doc/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html) role.

These rights are primarily needed for Avi LoadBalancer creation using the Services interface of the Cloud-Provider. If only the Instances interface is to be used, the vApp Author role does not need these additional rights.

#### Avi ServiceEngineGroup setup
A ServiceEngineGroup needs to be added to the gateway of the OVDC within which the Kubernetes cluster is to be created. The overall steps to achieve that are documented at [Enable Load Balancer on an NSX-T Data Center Edge Gateway](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.2/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-1784B96B-20F8-4E4D-BF33-86D2264EDBCF.html)
