  description: "VMware Cloud Director OpenAPI is a new API that is defined using the\
    \ OpenAPI standards.<br/>\nThis ReSTful API borrows some elements of the legacy\
    \ VMware Cloud Director API and establishes new patterns for use\nas described\
    \ below.\n<h4>Authentication</h4>\nAuthentication and Authorization schemes are\
    \ the same as those for the legacy APIs. You can authenticate\nusing the JWT token\
    \ via the <code>Authorization</code> header or specifying a session using\n<code>x-vcloud-authorization</code>\
    \ (The latter form is deprecated).\n<h4>Operation Patterns</h4>\nThis API follows\
    \ the following general guidelines to establish a consistent CRUD pattern:\n<table>\n\
    <tr>\n  <th>Operation</th><th>Description</th><th>Response Code</th><th>Response\
    \ Content</th>\n</tr><tr>\n  <td>GET /items<td>Returns a paginated list of items<td>200<td>Response\
    \ will include Navigational links to the items in the list.\n</tr><tr>\n  <td>POST\
    \ /items<td>Returns newly created item<td>201<td>Content-Location header links\
    \ to the newly created item\n</tr><tr>\n  <td>GET /items/urn<td>Returns an individual\
    \ item<td>200<td>A single item using same data type as that included in list above\n\
    </tr><tr>\n  <td>PUT /items/urn<td>Updates an individual item<td>200<td>Updated\
    \ view of the item is returned\n</tr><tr>\n  <td>DELETE /items/urn<td>Deletes\
    \ the item<td>204<td>No content is returned.\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h5>Asynchronous\
    \ operations</h5>\nAsynchronous operations are determined by the server. In those\
    \ cases, instead of responding as described above,\nthe server responds with an\
    \ HTTP Response code 202 and an empty body. The tracking task (which is the same\
    \ task as\nall legacy API operations use) is linked via the URI provided in the\
    \ <code>Location</code> header.<br/>\nAll API calls can choose to service a request\
    \ asynchronously or synchronously as determined by the server upon\ninterpreting\
    \ the request. Operations that choose to exhibit this dual behavior will have\
    \ both options documented by\nspecifying both response code(s) below. The caller\
    \ must be prepared to handle responses to such API calls by\ninspecting the HTTP\
    \ Response code.\n<h5>Error Conditions</h5>\n<b>All</b> operations report errors\
    \ using the following error reporting rules:\n<ul>\n  <li>400: Bad Request - In\
    \ event of bad request due to incorrect data or other user error</li>\n  <li>401:\
    \ Bad Request - If user is unauthenticated or their session has expired</li>\n\
    \  <li>403: Forbidden - If the user is not authorized or the entity does not exist</li>\n\
    </ul>\n<h4>OpenAPI Design Concepts and Principles</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>IDs are full\
    \ Uniform Resource Names (URNs).</li>\n  <li>OpenAPI's <code>Content-Type</code>\
    \ is always <code>application/json</code></li>\n  <li>REST links are in the Link\
    \ header.</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Multiple relationships for any link are represented\
    \ by multiple values in a space-separated list.</li>\n    <li>Links have a custom\
    \ VMware Cloud Director-specific &quot;model&quot; attribute that hints at the\
    \ applicable data\n        type for the links.</li>\n    <li>title + rel + model\
    \ attributes evaluates to a unique link.</li>\n    <li>Links follow Hypermedia\
    \ as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) principles. Links are present if\n\
    \        certain operations are present and permitted for the user&quot;s current\
    \ role and the state of the\n        referred entities.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>APIs\
    \ follow a flat structure relying on cross-referencing other entities instead\
    \ of the navigational style\n      used by the legacy VMware Cloud Director APIs.</li>\n\
    \  <li>Most endpoints that return a list support filtering and sorting similar\
    \ to the query service in the legacy\n      VMware Cloud Director APIs.</li>\n\
    \  <li>Accept header must be included to specify the API version for the request\
    \ similar to calls to existing legacy\n      VMware Cloud Director APIs.</li>\n\
    \  <li>Each feature has a version in the path element present in its URL.<br/>\n\
    \      <b>Note</b> API URL's without a version in their paths must be considered\
    \ experimental.</li>\n</ul>\n"
