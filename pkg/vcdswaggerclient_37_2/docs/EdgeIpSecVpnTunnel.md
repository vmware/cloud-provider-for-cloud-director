**Description** | **string** |  | [optional] [default to null]
**Enabled** | **bool** | Described whether the tunnel is enabled or not. The default is true. | [optional] [default to null]
**LocalEndpoint** | [***LocalEndpoint**](LocalEndpoint.md) | The Local Endpoint which corresponds to the Edge Gateway the tunnel is being configured on. Local Endpoint requires an IP. That IP must be suballocated to the edge gateway.  | [default to null]
**RemoteEndpoint** | [***RemoteEndpoint**](RemoteEndpoint.md) | The Remote Endpoints correspoinds to the device on the remote site terminating the VPN tunnel.  | [default to null]
**AuthenticationMode** | **string** | The authentication mode this IPSec tunnel will use to authenticate with the peer endpoint. The default is a pre-shared key (PSK). &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;PSK - A known key is shared between each site before the tunnel is established.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;CERTIFICATE - Incoming connections are required to present an identifying digital certificate, which VCD verifies has been signed by a trusted certificate authority.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  | [optional] [default to null]
**PreSharedKey** | **string** | This is the Pre-shared key used for authentication. | [optional] [default to null]
**CertificateRef** | [***EntityReference**](EntityReference.md) | The server certificate which will be used to secure the tunnel&#39;s local endpoint. The certificate must be the end-entity certificate (leaf) for the local endpoint.  | [optional] [default to null]
**CaCertificateRef** | [***EntityReference**](EntityReference.md) | The certificate authority used to verify the remote endpoint&#39;s certificate. The selected CA must be a root or intermediate CA. The selected CA should be able to directly verify the remote endpoint&#39;s certificate.  | [optional] [default to null]
**ConnectorInitiationMode** | [***ConnectorInitiationMode**](ConnectorInitiationMode.md) | This is the mode used by the local endpoint to establish an IKE Connection with the remote site. The default is INITIATOR. | [optional] [default to null]
**SecurityType** | **string** | This is the security type used for the IPSec Tunnel. If nothing is specified, this will be set to &#39;DEFAULT&#39; in which the default settings in NSX will be used.
