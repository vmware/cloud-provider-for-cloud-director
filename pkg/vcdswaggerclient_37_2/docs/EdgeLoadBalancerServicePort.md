# EdgeLoadBalancerServicePort

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**TcpUdpProfile** | [***EdgeLoadBalancerTcpUdpProfile**](EdgeLoadBalancerTcpUdpProfile.md) | Specifies the TCP/UDP profile for the service ports such as TCP_PROXY or TCP_FAST_PATH. If unset, a profile using the system-defined type of TCP_PROXY is used. This is valid for all Application Profiles. For L4 application profile type, user can set the profile to a different type such as TCP_FAST_PATH. For any other application profile type, the TCP/UDP profile type must be TCP_PROXY.  | [optional] [default to null]
**PortStart** | **int32** | The starting port number in the port range of the Virtual Service. If a single port is desired, only this field needs to be specified. An example is that HTTP uses port 80.  | [default to null]
**PortEnd** | **int32** | The ending port number in the port range of the Virtual Service.  This is not required if a single port is desired. | [optional] [default to null]
**SslEnabled** | **bool** | A flag indicating whether SSL termination is enabled at the port or not. This can only be enabled if HTTPS and L4_TLS Application Profile types are used. At least one service port must have ssl enabled when using HTTPS or L4_TLS Application Profile types. For HTTPS, if SSL is disabled for a specific port, traffic from that port will be redirected to the first SSL port specified. This allows for automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects.  | [optional] [default to null]
